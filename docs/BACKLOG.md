### V02: Flutter Dashboard UI — ✅ COMPLETE

**Priority:** P1 | **Estimated:** 10–12 hours (delivered — all 7 steps shipped; see Status below)

Implement authenticated dashboard with org switching, billing status, usage summaries, and entitlements display:

1. Create dashboard page with org switcher dropdown
2. Display current plan, billing status, next renewal date
3. Show monthly usage vs quota (bar/line chart for metrics)
4. Display feature entitlements grid (enabled/disabled flags)
5. Link to Stripe Customer Portal for billing self-service
6. Add real-time usage polling (refresh every 30s or on focus)
7. Error boundary and loading states for all async operations

**Architecture:**
- Use `provisioning_service.dart` for bootstrap/org context
- Integrate with `GET /v1/orgs/:id/dashboard`, `/v1/orgs/:id/usage/summary`, `/v1/orgs/:id/entitlements`
- Local state: active_org, entitlements, usage_snapshot (cached, TTL 30s)
- Global state: org_list, billing_status (cached, TTL 5min)

**Files to create:**
- `lib/pages/dashboard_page.dart`
- `lib/widgets/sections/dashboard_section.dart`
- `lib/services/dashboard_service.dart` (API client wrapper)

**Status:** ✅ ALL STEPS COMPLETE — Bootstrap flow complete; ✅ org switcher (step 1): `DashboardPage` at `/dashboard`, DropdownButton org switcher + nav cards to all sub-pages (commits 91cdae3, 226b568); ✅ billing status display (step 2): `BillingStatusPage` at `/billing`, plan name + status badge + renewal date, loading/error states, retry (commits 979ab7c, 60fd1ff); ✅ usage summary display (step 3): `UsageSummaryPage` at `/usage`, progress bar + per-metric breakdown (commits 55c4a86, e066900); ✅ usage charts (step 3): `_DailyBarChart` with `CustomPainter`, daily bar chart with quota reference line and threshold coloring (commits c78bbf1, 809496a); ✅ quota visualization (step 3 extended): `QuotaStatusPage` at `/quota`, minute burst + monthly limits with Unlimited label support, plan badge, fail-open DO handling (commits 9f93f67, e3ff7f3); ✅ entitlements display (step 4): `EntitlementsPage` at `/entitlements` with auto-generated feature flags (commit 9f93f67); ✅ Stripe Customer Portal link (step 5): `POST /v1/orgs/:id/billing-portal` with role check (owner/billing_admin), Stripe session creation, `fetchBillingPortalUrl` in DashboardService, "Manage Billing" button on BillingStatusPage (7 tests); ✅ real-time polling (step 6): 30s Timer.periodic + app-resume refresh on UsageSummaryPage, in-flight guard (commits f6581fd, d14280c). Code review findings: 1 H2-V02 latent JWT risk, 3 M-level (M30-M32: telemetry/validation/duplication), 2 L-level (L10-L11: decoration/docs) documented (80b288a).

## Deferred: OAuth Security (#8-#10) — ✅ COMPLETE

| Issue | Severity | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| #8 OAuth State Validation | CRITICAL | ✅ Done — `OAuthService.validateCallback()` with constant-time compare; CSRF rejection tracked in analytics (commit b957544) |
| #9 PKCE Implementation | CRITICAL | ✅ Done — `OAuthService.buildAuthorizationUrl()` with RFC 7636 S256 challenge; sessionStorage scoped; conditional web/stub exports (commit b957544) |

---

## Accepted Risk

### #23: KV Eventual Consistency Window

**Severity:** HIGH (accepted risk)
**Category:** Reliability
**File:** `workers/contact-form/src/index.ts:130-152`

KV is eventually consistent. Two requests from same IP at different datacenters can both read count=4, both increment to 5. Rate limit can be exceeded by ~2-3x.

**Status:** Accepted risk for contact form use case.

---

### #30: Multi-Environment CSP Endpoints

**Severity:** LOW (accepted)
**Category:** Infrastructure
**File:** `web/_headers`

Sentry `ingest.sentry.io` endpoint shared across staging and prod. CSP allows only one DSN per environment. Report DSN collision ignored when worker's `ENVIRONMENT` env var is not set (CF free plan limit).

**Status:** Accepted for landing page use case. Documented in `web/_headers`. If env-specific reporting is needed, use a build script to replace the DSN.

---

### M18-V01: Mutable JWT Claims (Phase 1 Remediation)

**Severity:** CRITICAL — ✅ FULLY REMEDIATED
**Category:** Security — Access Control Staleness
**File:** `workers/lib/types.zod.ts:39-45` | Commit: `312070b`

JWT tokens from Supabase included mutable billing state claims (`default_org_plan` and `default_org_billing_status`) that reflect values at token issuance time (up to 3600s stale). When these values change via Stripe webhooks, JWT claims remain immutable, violating SOC 2 CC6.1 (system monitoring) and creating stale-read access control vulnerabilities.

**Remediation completed:**
- ✅ Removed both claims from `JWTPayloadSchema` (commit `312070b`)
- ✅ Code already queries fresh values from database (`orgs.ts`)
- ✅ Added `.passthrough()` for backward compatibility with old tokens
- ✅ Supabase Custom Access Token Hook updated via migration `20260326000000_update_custom_access_token_hook.sql` — hook now emits only `org_ids`, `default_org_id`, `default_org_role`
- ✅ Hook enabled in `supabase/config.toml`
- ✅ `TWO_LAYER_AUTH_ARCHITECTURE.md` updated to reflect compliant JWT claims

**Status:** ✅ Complete.

## Deferred: Chrome Platform Tests (#77)

### #77: `flutter test --platform chrome` Hangs Indefinitely

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** Test Infrastructure (Platform-Level)
**File:** N/A — Flutter SDK issue
**Source:** Session 2026-02-12, validated 2026-02-25

`flutter test --platform chrome` (CanvasKit + headless Chrome) hangs on **exit** after all tests pass. Affects CI pipelines: test suite completes, Chrome stays alive, process never exits until CI timeout.

**Upstream:** [Flutter #162798](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/162798) — OPEN, marked for next stable release.

**Workaround:** N/A effective. Blocking factor.

**Status:** Blocked — re-tested on Flutter **3.44.4** (2026-07-12): `flutter test --platform chrome` still does not complete. It stalled at test loading/compilation for >6 min (observed twice) with headless Chrome + dart processes alive, never self-exiting — had to be killed. The anticipated v3.44 fix (upstream Flutter [#162798](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/162798)) does **not** resolve it in this environment; Chrome platform tests remain non-viable. Mitigation unchanged: the Flutter suite runs on the default (VM) platform in CI.

---

## Deferred: E2E Test Coverage Limitations (Flutter Canvas)

---

### #116: Page-Specific Meta Tags Per Route

**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** E2E Test Coverage (SEO)
**Files:** `e2e/tests/seo-meta.spec.ts`
**Source:** Coverage gap analysis 2026-03-11

Meta tags tested for home page only. Gaps:
- Dynamic `og:title`, `og:description` per route (e.g., `/pricing` should have "Pricing" in og:title)
- Route-specific canonical URLs
- Hreflang tags for i18n (if deployed)
- Page-specific JSON-LD (e.g., `Product` schema for /pricing)

**Status:** Deferred — Flutter SPA serves the same index.html for all routes; per-route meta requires Cloudflare Workers or edge-side rendering to inject dynamic tags. P3 SEO enhancement.

## Feature: Resume Upload on Careers Contact Form (#132)

### #132: Add File Upload to /contact?ref=careers

**Priority**: P2 | **Source**: session 2026-03-11

Add a file upload button (resume PDF/DOCX) to the contact form when `ref=careers`. Recommended architecture:

```
Browser (file_picker) → multipart POST → CF Worker → R2 bucket → Resend (path: r2_url)
```

This keeps CPU usage minimal and avoids the Cloudflare Workers free plan 10ms CPU limit. For a typical resume PDF (100KB–2MB), direct base64 encoding in the Worker might also work but is less reliable on the free tier.

**Key constraints:**
- `file_picker` package recommended for Flutter web file selection
- Resend supports attachments via `attachments[].path` (public URL) or `attachments[].content` (base64)
- Resend limit: 40MB per email (~30MB raw after base64 overhead)
- CF Workers free plan: 10ms CPU limit — base64 encoding large files can exceed this
- R2 approach avoids CPU-bound encoding; Resend fetches from the R2 URL server-side
- Blocked file types (Resend): `.exe`, `.bat`, `.js`, `.ps1`, etc. PDFs/DOCX are fine

**Implementation steps:**
1. Add `file_picker` dependency, show upload widget on `/contact?ref=careers`
2. Create R2 bucket for resume uploads
3. Update CF Worker to accept multipart POST, write file to R2, pass R2 URL to Resend
4. Add file type/size validation (client + server)

**Status:** Deferred — requires R2 bucket provisioning and Worker update.

---

### #133: Revert Careers CTA to "Submit Your Resume" After File Upload

**Priority**: P3 | **Source**: session 2026-03-11

Once #132 (resume upload) is implemented, revert the careers page CTA and copy:
- Button text: "Keep in Touch" → "Submit Your Resume"
- Description: restore "Send us your resume and a brief introduction..." (add "resume" back)

**Status:** Blocked on #132.

---

## Deferred: Server-Side Security Headers

These issues require **server-side HTTP response header configuration** and cannot be fixed in the Flutter app.

---


## Open Items

### T28: Handle Persistent Storage Data Loss Risk in Quota DO

**Priority:** P3 | **Source:** session 2026-03-20, quota commit review (523518f)
**Estimated:** 2–3 hours

Quota state is lazily persisted to Durable Object storage every 10 seconds (`workers/api-gateway/src/durable-objects/quota.ts:174–177`). If the DO crashes or is evicted between saves, up to 10 seconds of quota usage is lost (counts are dropped, monthly counter reverts).

**Scope:**
1. Evaluate risk appetite: Is 10-second data loss acceptable for quota tracking? (likely yes for low-tier plans, needs confirmation)
2. If higher durability is required:
   - Change save interval to synchronous: save immediately after every reservation (impacts latency)
   - OR batch saves: write to Durable Object every 100 requests OR 5 seconds (hybrid approach)
   - OR implement eventual consistency mode: accept up-to-10s drift, document in API contract
3. Document the chosen strategy in `workers/docs/QUOTA_DURABLE_OBJECTS.md` with:
   - Data consistency SLA
   - Acceptable loss window
   - When DO eviction is expected (low-traffic orgs evicted after 15 min idle)
4. Add monitoring: Cloudflare Durable Object metrics dashboard to track eviction rate

**Files to modify:**
- `workers/api-gateway/src/durable-objects/quota.ts` — Adjust save strategy (if needed)
- `workers/docs/QUOTA_DURABLE_OBJECTS.md` — Document durability guarantees and trade-offs

**Status:** Deferred — Documented but requires risk/latency trade-off decision and monitoring setup.

## Performance: Migrate Cloudflare Workers Validation from Zod to Valibot — ❌ WON'T DO

> **Closed 2026-07-12 — won't do.** The team standardized on **Zod v4**, not Valibot (no `valibot` dependency in any worker). The `functions/src/` paths in this item are also obsolete — worker validation lives in `workers/`. Rationale retained in [`docs/research/VALIBOT_ANALYSIS.md`](research/VALIBOT_ANALYSIS.md); see changelog 1.3 "Superseded Design-Doc Reconciliation".

### W01: Replace Zod with Valibot for Edge Function Validation

**Priority:** P2 | **Source:** session 2026-03-25, performance analysis
**Estimated:** 4–6 hours
**Context:** `functions/src/` Cloudflare Workers use Zod for validation. Valibot is significantly faster and smaller for edge functions.

**Analysis:** See `docs/research/VALIBOT_ANALYSIS.md` for full comparison. Key findings:
- **Bundle size:** Valibot 1.91 KB vs Zod 16.57 KB (90% reduction)
- **Startup:** Valibot 54 μs vs Zod ~864 μs (16x faster cold starts)
- **Impact:** Every KB shipped globally to edge datacenters; smaller bundle = faster parsing = lower CPU milliseconds billed
- **Trade-off:** Valibot slower on invalid data (exception-based), but Zod remains better for server-side Node.js (keep in api-gateway)

**Scope:**
1. Audit validation schemas in `functions/src/` — identify all Zod usage
2. Migrate schemas to Valibot API (mostly 1:1 mapping)
3. Update type exports: `z.infer<typeof S>` → `v.infer<typeof S>`
4. Benchmark with Wrangler: measure bundle size reduction and cold start improvement
5. Update `functions/package.json` to add Valibot + remove Zod dependency (if not shared with api-gateway)
6. Run `npm test` in functions/ directory to verify no regressions
7. Document in `functions/MIGRATION.md` if Valibot is adopted long-term

**Files to modify:**
- `functions/src/` (all validation schemas)
- `functions/package.json` (add valibot dependency)
- `functions/tsconfig.json` (if needed for types)

**Decision point:** Should api-gateway continue using Zod (server-side, better ecosystem) while functions/ uses Valibot (edge, better perf)?
- **Recommendation:** Yes — different contexts. Keep Zod in api-gateway (Node.js), migrate functions/ to Valibot (edge).

**Files to check:**
- `functions/src/_middleware.ts` — entry point; check if validates requests
- `functions/src/` — all TypeScript files for `z.` references

**Status:** ❌ Won't do (2026-07-12) — superseded by the Zod v4 standardization; workers use Zod, not Valibot. Rationale retained in `docs/research/VALIBOT_ANALYSIS.md`.

## W04: Provisioning workers — monitoring, alerting & dashboards

**Priority:** P2 | **Source:** session 2026-06-27, reconciled from provisioning setup notes (now consolidated into `docs/provisioning-environment-setup.md`) — open items "Monitoring and alerting — must implement", "Monitoring Dashboards — Cloudflare Analytics"
**Estimated:** 4–6 hours

**Context:** `sender-worker` has `[observability.logs]` with `invocation_logs = true` (`workers/sender-worker/wrangler.toml`), so logs are captured, but there is **no alerting and no dashboard** for the provisioning path (`sender-worker` → `api-provisioning-receiver`). The setup summary flagged this as "must implement" but it was never tracked as a real item. `api-provisioning-receiver` lives in the `observability-toolkit` repo, so end-to-end provisioning observability spans both repos.

**Scope:**
1. Define the signals that matter: `/send` error rate (esp. 502 "receiver-worker unreachable", 500 `INTERNAL_ERROR`), receiver 401s (signature/replay failures — possible attack or key-rotation drift), provisioning latency, Auth0/Supabase call failures.
2. Stand up a dashboard (Cloudflare Workers Analytics, or route through the existing OTEL pipeline — see `ingest.integritystudio.ai` / `observability-toolkit`) covering sender + receiver.
3. Add alerting on error-rate and 401-spike thresholds (channel/owner TBD).
4. Document the dashboard + alert runbook; cross-link from `docs/api-provisioning.md`.

**Notes / overlap:**
- [[T28]] already calls for a Cloudflare Durable Object metrics dashboard for quota eviction — narrower, but fold into the same dashboard effort if convenient.
- Receiver-side instrumentation belongs in `observability-toolkit`; coordinate across repos.

**Files to touch:**
- `workers/sender-worker/wrangler.toml` (if exporting metrics/OTEL beyond logs)
- `docs/api-provisioning.md` (link runbook)
- `observability-toolkit` (receiver-side spans/metrics)

**Status:** Open — reconciled from setup-summary intentions; needs signal definition + alert-channel decision. See also [[T28]].

## W05: Verify & document prod secret durability + rotation cadence under Doppler

**Priority:** P3 | **Source:** session 2026-06-27, reconciled from provisioning setup notes (now consolidated into `docs/provisioning-environment-setup.md`) — open items "Secrets backed up (1Password/Vault) — must implement", "Secret rotation documented (quarterly)"
**Estimated:** 1–2 hours

**Context:** The setup summary's "back up secrets to 1Password/Vault" action predates the move to **Doppler** as the managed secret store (`doppler --project integrity-studio --config dev|prd`, used by every worker's `deploy:prd` script and CI). Doppler is now the system of record for worker secrets, which largely supersedes a manual vault backup. This item reconciles the stale intention rather than implementing 1Password.

**Scope:**
1. Confirm Doppler `integrity-studio/prd` holds the canonical copy of all provisioning secrets (`SHARED_SECRET`, `SIGNING_KEYS`/`ACTIVE_KEY_ID`, `AUTH0_*`, `SUPABASE_*`, `STRIPE_*`) and that Doppler's own retention/backup is acceptable as the durability story.
2. Document whether an additional offline backup (1Password/Vault) is still required by policy, or formally accept Doppler as sufficient.
3. Document the secret-rotation cadence and procedure. **Note:** the rotation *mechanism* is already implemented and documented in code (`SIGNING_KEYS` + `ACTIVE_KEY_ID` + `x-key-id`, procedure in `workers/sender-worker/src/index.ts:150-158`) — this item is the operational policy/cadence, not new code.

**Files to touch:**
- `docs/provisioning-environment-setup.md` (secret durability + rotation cadence)
- `CLAUDE.md` "Secret Rotation" section (confirm/expand)

**Status:** Open — verification + documentation only; key-rotation mechanism already shipped. See also [[W02]] (Doppler-stored `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`).

---

## W06: Provisioning — nonce store for sub-window replay protection

**Priority:** P3 | **Source:** session 2026-06-27, documented in `docs/api-provisioning.md` (Production Hardening → Remaining) but not previously tracked
**Estimated:** 3–5 hours

**Context:** Replay protection on the `sender-worker` → `api-provisioning-receiver` path is currently timestamp-only: a signed `/inbox` request is accepted if its `x-timestamp` is within the ±5-minute `REPLAY_WINDOW_MS` window and the HMAC signature verifies. A captured request can therefore be replayed within that window. A nonce store (record each request's nonce/signature and reject duplicates) closes that gap. Low urgency — the window is narrow and the signature is constant-time verified — so this is a hardening enhancement, not a fix.

**Scope:**
1. Add a per-request nonce (or reuse the signature) and persist seen values with a TTL ≥ `REPLAY_WINDOW_MS` (Cloudflare KV or a Durable Object on the receiver in `observability-toolkit`).
2. Reject `/inbox` requests whose nonce has already been seen (401, distinct error code).
3. Confirm TTL ≥ replay window so entries can't expire while still replayable.

**Files to touch:**
- `api-provisioning-receiver` (`observability-toolkit` repo, `services/api-provisioning-receiver/`) — verification path
- `workers/sender-worker/src/` — emit nonce header if not reusing the signature
- `docs/api-provisioning.md` (Production Hardening) — move from Remaining to Shipped on completion

**Status:** Open — design decision (KV vs Durable Object; nonce vs signature dedup); receiver-side change lives in the `observability-toolkit` repo. See also [[W04]] (provisioning observability). The 2026-07-26 review raised the same gap against `workers/receiver-worker/src/index.ts:72`; that file is the local stub / test double and is not deployed, so this item remains the only real work — no separate entry was created for it.

## Code Review 2026-07-26 → 2026-07-27 (CR01–CR15)

Started as the open remainder of the 8-area codebase review; CR11–CR15 were found afterwards while deploying and auditing the workers. Fixed work lives in [`changelog/1.3/CHANGELOG.md`](changelog/1.3/CHANGELOG.md); the review's method, provenance, and 3 refuted claims are in [`CODE_REVIEW.md`](../CODE_REVIEW.md).

| ID | P | Status | One line |
|---|---|---|---|
| [CR01](#cr01) | P1 | ⚠️ partial | Untracked, but the bundle is still in git history and **no secret has been rotated** |
| [CR12](#cr12) | P1 | 🔴 open | Production `api-gateway` + `stripe-webhook` have **zero secrets**; gateway answers 503 |
| [CR11](#cr11) | P1 | 🔴 open | Doppler `dev` == `prd`; no data isolation. Detector: `npm run check:env-isolation` |
| [CR14](#cr14) | P1 | ⚠️ partial | Superseded versions publicly callable with live secrets; config fixed, **prod needs a deploy** |
| [CR02](#cr02) | P2 | ✅ mostly | Dev/prod split done and verified live; only the dev receiver remains |
| [CR04](#cr04) | P2 | ⚠️ partial | Comment corrected; JWT still travels in a URL fragment |
| [CR13](#cr13) | P2 | 🔴 open | Two repos claim `api.integritystudio.ai/v1/*` — needs an ownership decision |
| [CR03](#cr03) | P2 | ✅ done | KV namespaces created and bound; reaches prod on next `deploy:prd` |
| [CR15](#cr15) | P3 | ⚠️ partial | Observability fixed in config; two stale prod secrets still bound |

**Nothing here is blocked on code.** Every remaining item needs either a credential/provisioning decision (CR01, CR11), an answer about intent (CR12, CR13), or a production deploy to apply changes already committed (CR14, CR15, CR03).

**Three items are only "fixed" in config and are not yet live in production**, because `deploy:prd` has not run: CR03's KV binding, CR14's `preview_urls = false`, and CR15's observability. CI deploys `sender-worker` on merge to `main`; the other workers deploy manually.

### CR01: `doppler.json` encrypted secrets bundle is committed to the repository

**Priority:** P1 | **Source:** session 2026-07-26, codebase review (Medium)
**Estimated:** 2–4 hours + rotation window

**Context:** `doppler.json` at the repo root is a 37 KB Doppler CLI encrypted secrets snapshot (`4:base64:500000:<salt>-…`), tracked in git since commit `faf0ccc`. Anyone with repo read access holds a permanent offline copy of every worker secret — Auth0 client secrets, the Supabase service-role key, Stripe keys, the HMAC shared secret — decryptable the moment any Doppler token leaks, or brute-forceable offline at leisure. Rotating a leaked token does not retract the copy. This also contradicts the repo's own deployment-safety claim of "no hardcoded secrets".

**Scope:**
1. `git rm --cached doppler.json`; add to `.gitignore`.
2. Scrub it from history (`git filter-repo` or BFG) and force-push; coordinate with anyone holding clones.
3. Rotate every secret the bundle contains — assume the whole set is compromised.
4. Confirm nothing in CI or the deploy scripts reads the file.

**Status:** Partially done (2026-07-26, commit 88ef77a) — step 1 complete: `git rm --cached doppler.json` + `.gitignore` entry added. Steps 2–3 (history scrub + secret rotation) still require an owner and a maintenance window. See also [[W05]] (Doppler durability + rotation policy).

### CR02: Worker deploys have no dev/prod separation — `npm run deploy` overwrites production

**Priority:** P2 (was P1 — the overwrite risk is closed; what remains is dev-environment fidelity) | **Source:** session 2026-07-26, codebase review (Medium)
**Estimated:** 3–5 hours → ~1 hour remaining, plus a cross-repo change

**Context:** Each worker's `deploy` (Doppler `dev`) and `deploy:prd` (Doppler `prd`) both run a plain `wrangler deploy` against a single-name `wrangler.toml` with no `[env]` blocks. Doppler changes only the credentials injected into the deploy process, not the deploy target, so a local `npm run deploy` publishes straight over the worker production uses. For `sender-worker` that is the exact worker the released site calls: `ci.yml:212` builds with no `--dart-define`, so the app falls back to the compile-time default `https://sender-worker.alyshia-b38.workers.dev` (`lib/services/provisioning_service.dart:15`). CLAUDE.md's claim that `npm run deploy` "deploys to dev environment" is false — there is no dev environment.

**Scope:**
1. ~~Add `[env.dev]` blocks with distinct worker names per worker.~~ Done 2026-07-27.
2. ~~Make `deploy` pass `--env dev`.~~ Done 2026-07-27. **`deploy:prd` deliberately still passes no `--env`** — see the design note below.
3. ~~Point the dev Flutter build at the dev worker via `--dart-define`.~~ Documented in CLAUDE.md 2026-07-27.
4. ~~Correct the deployment section of CLAUDE.md.~~ Done 2026-07-27.
5. **Remaining — deploy a dev receiver.** `sender-worker-dev` still binds `RECEIVER` to the production `api-provisioning-receiver`; no dev receiver exists (it lives in the `observability-toolkit` repo). `/send` from a dev deploy reaches the production receiver. Cross-repo.
6. ~~Give `contact-form-dev` its own KV namespace.~~ Done 2026-07-27 — `CONTACT_RATE_LIMIT_KV_DEV` (`5719e569…`), distinct from the production namespace so a dev deploy cannot evict live rate-limit and idempotency keys. A test now asserts dev never shares a namespace with production.
7. ~~Verify by deploying.~~ Done 2026-07-27 — `npm run deploy` was run for real in `workers/sender-worker` and landed on `sender-worker-dev`, not `sender-worker`. All five dev workers deployed; the four production workers were confirmed unmodified afterwards by their `modified_on` timestamps.

**Design note — why production stayed on the top-level config.** The original scope proposed `[env.production]` with `deploy:prd --env production`. That would have been actively harmful: a named environment renames the Worker (`sender-worker` → `sender-worker-production`), orphaning its Durable Object namespaces, routes, and crons, and breaking both the Flutter compile-time default URL and the receiver's service binding. Instead the top-level block **is** production and is untouched; `[env.dev]` is the overlay. The production deploy path is byte-identical to before this change.

**CR02a — resolved.** The routes had already moved to top level in `a0fca5c`, so they now attach on the plain `deploy:prd`. The `QUOTA_DO` binding concern is handled by repeating it under `[env.dev]` (wrangler does not inherit `durable_objects` into named environments) while leaving the top-level binding in place. `migrations` is inheritable and applies to both. The unused `[env.staging]` block was left alone — dead, but harmless, and nothing deploys it.

**Status:** Done and verified live (2026-07-27) — `npm run deploy` can no longer overwrite a production worker, enforced by `workers/lib/deploy-environments.test.ts` (31 tests, mutation-verified) and confirmed by an actual deploy. Only item 5 remains (dev receiver, cross-repo).

**Read [[CR11]] before treating the dev workers as an environment.** The structural split is real, but Doppler's `dev` and `prd` configs hold identical credentials, so there is no data isolation behind it. The dev workers were deployed without secrets on purpose.

### CR03: Auth rate limiting is per-isolate only — `RATE_LIMIT_KV` namespace was never created

**Priority:** P2 | **Source:** session 2026-07-26, verifying the review's remediation pass
**Estimated:** 15 minutes (one `wrangler` command + two IDs)

> **Correction (2026-07-27).** This entry previously read "the limiter is inert" and "**fails open**", citing `utils.ts:86` (`if (!env.RATE_LIMIT_KV) return { allowed: true }`). That was a misreading of the early return, and it was wrong: the in-memory tier above line 86 has already counted the request and denies at the limit, so that line skips only the KV tier. Tests at `utils.test.ts` have proved 429-without-KV since `38b2878`. The item is real but much smaller than described, and has been repriced P1 → P2.

**Context:** `checkAuthRateLimit()` in `workers/sender-worker/src/utils.ts` enforces `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (10 per 600s) per IP on `/signup` and `/signin`, returning 429 with `Retry-After`. It counts in memory first and always enforces on that count; `RATE_LIMIT_KV` adds an authoritative count shared across isolates and colos.

The remaining gap is **accuracy, not absence**. In-memory state is per isolate, so an attacker who spreads attempts across colos, or who waits out isolate recycling, gets more than 10 attempts per window in aggregate. A single-connection brute force is still stopped. The `[[kv_namespaces]]` block in `wrangler.toml` is commented out because placeholder IDs break the deploy (`a392cd6`).

**Scope:**
1. ~~Make the degraded mode observable~~ — done 2026-07-27: warns once per isolate when the binding is absent, and the misleading "fail-open-looking" early return is documented and pinned by tests.
2. `wrangler kv namespace create RATE_LIMIT_KV` and `wrangler kv namespace create RATE_LIMIT_KV --preview`.
3. Uncomment the `[[kv_namespaces]]` block in `workers/sender-worker/wrangler.toml` and fill in both IDs.
4. Deploy and confirm a burst returns 429. **Blocked on [[CR02]]** — `npm run deploy` currently publishes over the worker production uses, so there is no safe way to test this deploy first.

**Status:** ✅ Done (2026-07-27) — namespaces created and bound. Production `sender-worker` binds `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_KV` (`766332ec…`); `sender-worker-dev` binds its own `dev-RATE_LIMIT_KV` (`46a717cd…`). Titled `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_KV` rather than `RATE_LIMIT_KV` because contact-form already owned that title — the two workers must not share a namespace. The binding reaches production on the next `deploy:prd`; `sender-worker-dev` is deployed and healthy with it bound.

### CR04: Dashboard handoff still passes the JWT in a URL fragment

**Priority:** P2 | **Source:** session 2026-07-26, verifying the review's remediation pass
**Estimated:** 3–4 hours (coordinated with the dashboard app)

**Context:** The review's "JWT accepted and propagated via URLs" finding was marked fixed. The `?jwt=` router entry point is genuinely gone, which removes the login-CSRF deep-link vector. The dashboard redirect moved from `?access_token=` to `#access_token=` (`lib/pages/provision_page.dart:90`), and a fragment is not sent to the server, so proxy/server-log and `Referer` leaks are closed. The token is still in a URL, though: fragments are stored with the browser-history entry — contrary to the comment on that line — and any script on the dashboard origin can read `location.hash`.

**Scope:**
1. Replace the fragment handoff with `postMessage` to the dashboard origin, or a single-use exchange code redeemed for the JWT.
2. Correct the comment at `provision_page.dart:87-89`, which overstates what a fragment protects.
3. Requires a matching change in the dashboard app.

**Status:** Partially done (2026-07-26, commit d632263) — misleading comment corrected in `provision_page.dart:87-91`. Full fix (postMessage / exchange code) requires a coordinated change in the dashboard app.

### CR11: Doppler `dev` is not a separate environment

**Priority:** P1 | **Source:** session 2026-07-27, deploying the CR02 dev environments
**Estimated:** ~2 hours once the provisioning decisions are made

**Detector:** `npm run check:env-isolation` — compares credential hashes between the two configs, prints no secret material, exits non-zero while they are shared. **Currently fails 10 of 10.** A green run is the definition of done for this item.

**Context:** `--config dev` and `--config prd` resolve to the same Supabase project (`cfrbahzzklwrnmbtqojl`), the same Auth0 tenant, and the same `SHARED_SECRET`. Anything run against the dev config reads and writes production state. CLAUDE.md's "E2E tests use `--config dev` (isolated from prod)" was false and is now corrected in place.

Facts established while investigating, several of which correct earlier notes in this file:

- **Stripe is not exposed.** `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is **empty in all three configs**; the key actually in use is `STRIPE_API_KEY`, and it is `sk_test_…` in both dev and prd. An earlier version of this entry implied live-key risk — there is none. (Worth a separate question: production is configured with a *test* Stripe key.)
- **The `stg` config is empty**, not a third environment — every credential above is unset in it. It is available to repurpose as the dev target.
- **Worker secrets do not come from Doppler.** `wrangler deploy` does not convert ambient env vars into Worker secrets; they are set per worker with `wrangler secret put`. So this item does not by itself mean the deployed workers are misconfigured — it means every *local* and *CI* process using the dev config touches production.
- **The `*-dev` workers have zero secrets bound** (verified via the Workers API) and were deployed that way deliberately. They cannot reach production data. Do not push the current dev values into them: that would create a second production-capable worker, not a dev environment.
- **Both Supabase projects are `INACTIVE`** (free-tier pause), and the org has 2 of them. A third project may require a plan change — that is the decision blocking step 1.

**Scope:**
1. **Decide the Supabase boundary.** Either a new project (may need a paid plan — the org already has 2) or a separate schema in `cfrbahzzklwrnmbtqojl` with its own role. A separate schema is cheaper but shares the service-role key, so it does not isolate credentials — only a separate project makes the checker pass on `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
2. **Create an Auth0 dev tenant** and a matching M2M + ROPC application pair. Not scriptable with the current credentials: the `AUTH0_CLI_*` M2M app is scoped to the existing tenant's Management API, so it cannot create tenants. Dashboard action.
3. **Populate Doppler.** Write the new values into `dev` (or into the empty `stg` config, promoting it to the dev target). Re-run `npm run check:env-isolation` until it passes.
4. **Push the dev secrets to the `*-dev` workers** — only after step 3 passes, never before:
   ```bash
   for s in SUPABASE_URL SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY AUTH0_DOMAIN AUTH0_CLIENT_ID AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET AUTH0_CLI_ID AUTH0_CLI_SECRET AUTH0_AUDIENCE SHARED_SECRET; do
     doppler secrets get "$s" --project integrity-studio --config dev --plain \
       | npx wrangler secret put "$s" --env dev
   done
   ```
5. **Change `contact-form`'s dev recipient before giving dev a `RESEND_API_KEY`.** `[env.dev.vars]` currently carries the production addresses — `RECIPIENT_EMAIL = hello@integritystudio.ai`, `SENDER_EMAIL = contact@integritystudio.ai` — so the moment dev holds a Resend key, dev test submissions land in the real business inbox. Harmless today only because the key is absent and the worker fails closed without `CSRF_SECRET`.
6. **Verify.** Run a dev signup against `sender-worker-dev` and confirm no row appears in the production `organizations` / `users` tables.
7. **Point the E2E suite at the dev workers** via the `--dart-define` URLs in CLAUDE.md, so the corrected isolation claim becomes true rather than merely accurate.

**Status:** Open — blocked on two owner decisions: whether to pay for a third Supabase project (step 1) and creating the Auth0 dev tenant (step 2), neither of which is scriptable with the credentials available. Everything downstream of those (steps 3–6) is mechanical and the runbook above is complete. The detector and the documentation corrections landed 2026-07-27.

### CR12: Production `api-gateway` and `stripe-webhook` have zero secrets bound and are degraded

**Priority:** P1 | **Source:** session 2026-07-27, auditing worker secrets while investigating CR11
**Estimated:** 30 minutes to restore, longer to explain

**Context:** Querying the Workers API for the secrets bound to each deployed worker returns **zero** for both `api-gateway` and `stripe-webhook`:

| Worker | Secrets bound | Last deployed |
|---|---|---|
| `sender-worker` | 13 | 2026-07-26 |
| `integrity-studio-contact` | 2 (`CSRF_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`) | 2026-03-31 |
| **`api-gateway`** | **0** | 2026-03-31 |
| **`stripe-webhook`** | **0** | 2026-03-31 |

`api-gateway`'s own `wrangler.toml` documents five required secrets (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `API_KEY_HMAC_SECRET`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`). None are set. Its health endpoint confirms the consequence:

```
GET https://api-gateway.alyshia-b38.workers.dev/health
503 {"database":"degraded","durableObjects":"healthy",...}
```

Verified by two independent sources: the Workers REST API, and `wrangler secret list --name api-gateway` returning `[]` (control: `sender-worker` returns 13 by the same method).

So every authenticated route that touches Supabase — usage, entitlements, orgs, me, api-keys — cannot work, and `stripe-webhook` cannot verify a signature or reach the database, meaning subscription events are dropped rather than dead-lettered. **Correction (2026-07-27):** an earlier version of this entry cited `api.integritystudio.ai/v1/me` returning `401 Missing or invalid Bearer token` as proof the production route was attached and working. That response came from `api-gateway-dev`, not `api-gateway` — see CR13. Production `api-gateway` has **no zone route at all**; the only routes on `integritystudio.ai` are `api.integritystudio.ai/*` → `obtool-api` and `ingest.integritystudio.ai/*` → `obtool-ingest`. It is reachable solely at its `workers.dev` hostname, which is what the Flutter app calls.

**`https://api-gateway.alyshia-b38.workers.dev` is the production gateway**, not a dev URL — and it is the URL the shipped app actually calls. It is the compile-time default for `API_GATEWAY_URL` in both `lib/services/dashboard_service.dart:16` and `lib/services/provisioning_service.dart:22`, and `ci.yml` builds with no `--dart-define`. The dev worker is the separate script `api-gateway-dev`. So the 503 is on the live user path, not a back channel.

*(Correction: an earlier revision argued the two were distinct because `api-gateway-dev`'s `workers.dev` subdomain "is not even enabled — returns Cloudflare 1042". That was propagation lag moments after creation. The subdomain is enabled and now answers 503 with the same body as production. The workers are still demonstrably distinct — separate scripts, and separate Durable Object namespaces: `14813730…` bound to `api-gateway`, `30f146ce…` to `api-gateway-dev` — so the conclusion holds and the DO-isolation claim in the changelog is confirmed. Only that piece of evidence was wrong.)*

`degraded` rather than `unhealthy` is consistent with unset secrets: `checkDatabase` gets `undefined` for `supabaseUrl`, the shared client catches the resulting invalid-URL throw and returns `{ok: false}`, which maps to `degraded`. It does not distinguish this from a reachable-but-failing database — and both causes are present, because **both Supabase projects are `INACTIVE`** (free-tier pause).

**Monitoring trap:** the health route is `/health` at the root, but the custom domain only routes `api.integritystudio.ai/v1/*`, so the gateway's health check is unreachable there. Worse, `https://api.integritystudio.ai/health` returns **200** — served by the marketing site, nothing to do with the gateway. Any uptime check pointed at that URL is permanently green regardless of gateway state. Point step 3 at `https://api-gateway.alyshia-b38.workers.dev/health`, or add a `/v1/health` route.

**Scope:**
1. Determine whether this is expected — i.e. whether the platform is pre-launch and these two workers were never configured, or whether secrets were lost in a redeploy. The 2026-03-31 timestamp on both suggests they have been in this state for ~4 months.
2. If live traffic is expected: set the documented secrets (`wrangler secret put --name api-gateway`), resume the Supabase project, and re-check `/health`.
3. Add `/health` to an uptime check so a degraded gateway is not discovered incidentally during a code review four months later.
4. Reconcile with the many changelog entries describing api-gateway quota, usage, and entitlements work — that code has been shipped against a gateway that cannot reach its database.

**Status:** Open — needs an owner answer to step 1 before anything is changed. Not remediated in this session: setting production secrets on a live worker is not a change to make unasked, and the correct values depend on whether CR11's isolation work lands first.

### CR13: Decide what should serve `api.integritystudio.ai/v1/*` (cross-repo ownership)

**Priority:** P2 | **Source:** session 2026-07-27, after a dev deploy inadvertently claimed the route
**Estimated:** 30 minutes, once the ownership question is answered

**Context:** `workers/api-gateway/wrangler.toml` declares `routes = [api.integritystudio.ai/v1/*]` at the top level, so a `npm run deploy:prd` from this repo **will claim that hostname path** for `api-gateway`. But the zone's routes are currently:

| Pattern | Worker | Owned by |
|---|---|---|
| `api.integritystudio.ai/*` | `obtool-api` | observability-toolkit |
| `ingest.integritystudio.ai/*` | `obtool-ingest` | observability-toolkit |

`obtool-api` holds the wildcard, and there is no `/v1/*` route, so `/v1/*` requests currently fall through to `obtool-api`. Two repos therefore both believe they own paths under `api.integritystudio.ai`, and the more specific pattern wins whenever this repo deploys to production. Nobody has decided which is intended.

**How this surfaced:** a `wrangler deploy --env dev` from this repo created `api.integritystudio.ai/v1/* -> api-gateway-dev` (route inheritance — see CR12's note and the comment in `api-gateway/wrangler.toml`). For roughly 14 hours on 2026-07-27, that path was served by a secret-less dev Worker. The route was deleted and the prior fall-through restored; the config now carries an explicit `routes = []` and a test enforces it.

**Scope:**
1. Decide whether `api.integritystudio.ai/v1/*` should be served by this repo's `api-gateway` or by `obtool-api`.
2. If `api-gateway`: resolve [[CR12]] first (it has no secrets and answers 503), then `deploy:prd` to attach the route deliberately, and confirm with the observability-toolkit owner that removing `/v1/*` from `obtool-api`'s wildcard is safe.
3. If `obtool-api`: delete the `routes` key from `workers/api-gateway/wrangler.toml` so a production deploy stops silently claiming a hostname this repo does not own, and point the Flutter `API_GATEWAY_URL` default at whatever is correct.
4. Either way, stop relying on the `workers.dev` hostname as the app's production default (`dashboard_service.dart:16`, `provisioning_service.dart:22`).

**Status:** Open — needs a cross-repo ownership decision. The unsafe intermediate state (dev Worker on the production hostname) is resolved.

### CR14: Superseded Worker versions stay publicly callable with live secrets

**Priority:** P1 | **Source:** session 2026-07-27, auditing `api-gateway-dev` settings via the Cloudflare API
**Estimated:** 15 minutes to mitigate; the audit of what old versions expose is longer

**Context:** Every Worker in the account has `previews_enabled: true`. Cloudflare then publishes each retained version at `https://<version-id-prefix>-<script>.<subdomain>.workers.dev`, **with the script's current secrets bound**. Superseded code therefore stays live.

Verified, not theoretical:

| URL | Version date | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `6a5b6edf-sender-worker.…workers.dev/health` | 2026-07-26 (current) | `200` |
| `b2c2b878-sender-worker.…workers.dev/health` | **2026-04-20** | **`200` — live** |
| `15f2bcf0-sender-worker.…workers.dev/health` | 2026-04-10 | `404` (past retention) |

The `b2c2b878` version predates this branch's security work: the per-IP auth rate limit (`38b2878`), the signup compensating rollback (`c75592c`), the CORS origin-reflection fix (`66f1825`), and the JWT-in-URL removal (`c55dcff`). It answers requests today with all 13 production secrets bound. **So merging and deploying this branch does not fully retire the vulnerabilities it fixes** — the un-fixed code remains reachable at a parallel URL.

Workers with both secrets and preview URLs enabled:

| Worker | Secrets | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sender-worker` | 13 | Auth0 ROPC + M2M, Supabase service-role, HMAC `SHARED_SECRET` |
| `api-provisioning-receiver` | 7 | **Different repo** (`observability-toolkit`) — needs that owner |
| `integrity-studio-contact` | 2 | `CSRF_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY` |

The 8-hex-character version prefix is not a meaningful secret: `wrangler` prints the full version ID on every deploy, so it lands in terminal scrollback and CI logs. This session printed one.

**Scope:**
1. ~~Set `preview_urls = false`~~ — done 2026-07-27 in `sender-worker` and `contact-form` `wrangler.toml`. **Takes effect on their next deploy**, so it is not yet mitigated in production.
2. **Immediate mitigation without a deploy**, per worker:
   ```bash
   doppler run --project integrity-studio --config prd -- sh -c \
     'curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"previews_enabled\":false}" \
       "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/workers/scripts/sender-worker/subdomain"'
   ```
3. Ask the `observability-toolkit` owner to do the same for `api-provisioning-receiver` (7 secrets, not deployable from here).
4. ~~Decide whether preview URLs are wanted on the `*-dev` workers.~~ Resolved 2026-07-27. **`preview_urls` is an inheritable key** — verified by deploying `sender-worker-dev` and `integrity-studio-contact-dev` after setting it only at the top level, and confirming both flipped to `previews_enabled: false`. So no `[env.dev]` duplicate is needed, and the dev workers are already covered before [[CR11]] step 4 adds secrets. (Contrast with the *non*-inheritable binding keys — the asymmetry is documented in `api-gateway/wrangler.toml`.)
5. Consider whether any retained version predates a *data-handling* change (schema, consent, retention), not just a security fix.

**Status:** Open — config committed, production not yet mitigated. Steps 2–3 are production/cross-repo settings changes and were deliberately not made unasked.

### CR15: Production `sender-worker` config drift found in the settings audit

**Priority:** P3 | **Source:** session 2026-07-27, auditing `sender-worker-dev` against production
**Estimated:** 20 minutes

Two items, both on the production worker, both surfaced by diffing it against its new dev counterpart.

**1. Workers Logs are not on — config fixed 2026-07-27, reaches production on the next `deploy:prd`.** Production `sender-worker` reports `observability.enabled: false` with `observability.logs.enabled: true`; the dev worker reports `enabled: true` for both. The cause is `wrangler.toml`: the top-level block is

```toml
[observability]
[observability.logs]
enabled = true
```

— `[observability]` declares no `enabled` key, so it deploys as `false`, while `[env.dev.observability]` sets `enabled = true` explicitly and therefore differs. A changelog entry from 2026-04-03 records "Enabled observability logs on sender-worker", which may never have taken effect. This matters beyond tidiness: diagnosing [[CR12]] and confirming [[CR03]]'s rate limiter both depend on being able to read worker logs.

**Confirmed by experiment, not inference.** A scratch deploy of `bootstrap-worker-dev` with `logs.enabled = true` and `traces.enabled = true` but no parent `enabled` reported `observability.enabled: false`; adding `enabled = true` to the parent flipped it to `true`. The child tables alone do nothing. (Experiment reverted and the worker redeployed clean.)

`sender-worker`'s config now sets `enabled = true` on the parent plus `logs` and `traces`, and `sender-worker-dev` verifies as `enabled=True logs=True invocation=True traces=True`. Production still reports `enabled: false` and will until the next `deploy:prd` — which CI runs automatically on merge to `main`.

A second gotcha found the same way: **a named environment's `observability` block replaces the parent's rather than merging.** `[env.dev.observability]` had to repeat `traces` or dev would have silently run without them while production had them. This is a third distinct inheritance behaviour, alongside the non-inheritable bindings and the inheritable `routes`/`triggers`/`preview_urls`.

**2. Two stale secrets remain bound.** `RECEIVER_WORKER_URL` and `PROVISIONING_RECEIVER_WORKER_URL` are still set on production `sender-worker`, left over from before the service-binding migration (`d450ef4`). Nothing in `workers/sender-worker/src/` reads either name — verified by grep — so they are inert, but they are two more credentials in the blast radius of [[CR01]] and they imply an HTTP path to the receiver that no longer exists. Remove with:

```bash
npx wrangler secret delete RECEIVER_WORKER_URL --name sender-worker
npx wrangler secret delete PROVISIONING_RECEIVER_WORKER_URL --name sender-worker
```

**Status:** Open — item 1 is a one-line config change deferred to the next production deploy; item 2 deletes production secrets and was not done unasked.

Added CR01–CR10 for the remainder: the 5 items never fixed, 2 marked-fixed-but-not-closed (inert rate limiter, JWT still in a URL fragment), and 3 found while converting the api-gateway and stripe-webhook tests to drive a real Supabase client over a stubbed transport. Test Status: ✅ 3,001 Flutter + 984 worker tests passing; zero TypeScript errors across all 7 workers.*

*Backlog-implementer session (2026-07-26): CR01 doppler.json removed from git + .gitignore (88ef77a); CR05 usage/entitlements endpoints return 5xx on DB error (d11cf38); CR06 me.ts splits DB error from 404 (d11cf38); CR04 provision_page.dart comment corrected (d632263); CR07 CLAUDE.md status block refreshed (8d4c8e2); CR08 ~18 dead Array.isArray checks removed (2ada4e9); CR09 handler test fixtures use HTTP-format errors (424bbd2); CR10 fetchPendingDeadLetters null phantom filtered (1a8196a). CR02 (dev/prod separation) and CR03 (RATE_LIMIT_KV) deferred — need live wrangler/CF operations. CR01 steps 2–3 (history scrub + rotation) deferred to maintenance window. CR04 full fix deferred — cross-repo. CR05–CR10 migrated to the 1.3 changelog (*Review Backlog Pass*) and removed from this section. Test Status: ✅ 3,001 Flutter + 984 worker tests passing; zero TypeScript errors across all 7 workers.*

**Remaining for v1 release:**

### V02: Flutter Dashboard UI

**Priority:** P1 | **Estimated:** 10–12 hours

Implement authenticated dashboard with org switching, billing status, usage summaries, and entitlements display:

1. Create dashboard page with org switcher dropdown
2. Display current plan, billing status, next renewal date
3. Show monthly usage vs quota (bar/line chart for metrics)
4. Display feature entitlements grid (enabled/disabled flags)
5. Link to Stripe Customer Portal for billing self-service
6. Add real-time usage polling (refresh every 30s or on focus)
7. Error boundary and loading states for all async operations

**Architecture:**
- Use `provisioning_service.dart` for bootstrap/org context
- Integrate with `GET /v1/orgs/:id/dashboard`, `/v1/orgs/:id/usage/summary`, `/v1/orgs/:id/entitlements`
- Local state: active_org, entitlements, usage_snapshot (cached, TTL 30s)
- Global state: org_list, billing_status (cached, TTL 5min)

**Files to create:**
- `lib/pages/dashboard_page.dart`
- `lib/widgets/sections/dashboard_section.dart`
- `lib/services/dashboard_service.dart` (API client wrapper)

**Status:** ✅ ALL STEPS COMPLETE — Bootstrap flow complete; ✅ org switcher (step 1): `DashboardPage` at `/dashboard`, DropdownButton org switcher + nav cards to all sub-pages (commits 91cdae3, 226b568); ✅ billing status display (step 2): `BillingStatusPage` at `/billing`, plan name + status badge + renewal date, loading/error states, retry (commits 979ab7c, 60fd1ff); ✅ usage summary display (step 3): `UsageSummaryPage` at `/usage`, progress bar + per-metric breakdown (commits 55c4a86, e066900); ✅ usage charts (step 3): `_DailyBarChart` with `CustomPainter`, daily bar chart with quota reference line and threshold coloring (commits c78bbf1, 809496a); ✅ quota visualization (step 3 extended): `QuotaStatusPage` at `/quota`, minute burst + monthly limits with Unlimited label support, plan badge, fail-open DO handling (commits 9f93f67, e3ff7f3); ✅ entitlements display (step 4): `EntitlementsPage` at `/entitlements` with auto-generated feature flags (commit 9f93f67); ✅ Stripe Customer Portal link (step 5): `POST /v1/orgs/:id/billing-portal` with role check (owner/billing_admin), Stripe session creation, `fetchBillingPortalUrl` in DashboardService, "Manage Billing" button on BillingStatusPage (7 tests); ✅ real-time polling (step 6): 30s Timer.periodic + app-resume refresh on UsageSummaryPage, in-flight guard (commits f6581fd, d14280c). Code review findings: 1 H2-V02 latent JWT risk, 3 M-level (M30-M32: telemetry/validation/duplication), 2 L-level (L10-L11: decoration/docs) documented (80b288a).

## Deferred: OAuth Security (#8-#10)

## Deferred: OAuth Security (#8-#10)

These issues are **deferred** because this is a landing page with placeholder OAuth callback UI and no OAuth backend.
When OAuth is implemented, these MUST be added.

| Issue | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| #8 OAuth State Validation | CRITICAL | CSRF via unvalidated `state` parameter |
| #9 PKCE Implementation | CRITICAL | Authorization code interception (RFC 7636) |

See git history for full implementation plans (removed from backlog on 2026-02-12 migration to CHANGELOG).

## Accepted Risk

### #23: KV Eventual Consistency Window

**Severity:** HIGH (accepted risk)
**Category:** Reliability
**File:** `workers/contact-form/src/index.ts:130-152`

KV is eventually consistent. Two requests from same IP at different datacenters can both read count=4, both increment to 5. Rate limit can be exceeded by ~2-3x.

**Status:** Accepted risk for contact form use case.

---

### #30: Multi-Environment CSP Endpoints

**Severity:** LOW (accepted)
**Category:** Infrastructure
**File:** `web/_headers`

Sentry `ingest.sentry.io` endpoint shared across staging and prod. CSP allows only one DSN per environment. Report DSN collision ignored when worker's `ENVIRONMENT` env var is not set (CF free plan limit).

**Status:** Accepted for landing page use case. Documented in `web/_headers`. If env-specific reporting is needed, use a build script to replace the DSN.

---

## Deferred: Chrome Platform Tests (#77)

### #77: `flutter test --platform chrome` Hangs Indefinitely

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** Test Infrastructure (Platform-Level)
**File:** N/A — Flutter SDK issue
**Source:** Session 2026-02-12, validated 2026-02-25

`flutter test --platform chrome` (CanvasKit + headless Chrome) hangs on **exit** after all tests pass. Affects CI pipelines: test suite completes, Chrome stays alive, process never exits until CI timeout.

**Upstream:** [Flutter #162798](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/162798) — OPEN, marked for next stable release.

**Workaround:** N/A effective. Blocking factor.

**Status:** Blocked — `flutter test --platform chrome` hangs indefinitely (upstream Flutter issue #162798). Next stable v3.44 planned May 2026 with fix.

---

## Deferred: E2E Test Coverage Limitations (Flutter Canvas)

---

### #116: Page-Specific Meta Tags Per Route

**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** E2E Test Coverage (SEO)
**Files:** `e2e/tests/seo-meta.spec.ts`
**Source:** Coverage gap analysis 2026-03-11

Meta tags tested for home page only. Gaps:
- Dynamic `og:title`, `og:description` per route (e.g., `/pricing` should have "Pricing" in og:title)
- Route-specific canonical URLs
- Hreflang tags for i18n (if deployed)
- Page-specific JSON-LD (e.g., `Product` schema for /pricing)

**Status:** Deferred — Flutter SPA serves the same index.html for all routes; per-route meta requires Cloudflare Workers or edge-side rendering to inject dynamic tags. P3 SEO enhancement.

## Feature: Resume Upload on Careers Contact Form (#132)

### #132: Add File Upload to /contact?ref=careers

**Priority**: P2 | **Source**: session 2026-03-11

Add a file upload button (resume PDF/DOCX) to the contact form when `ref=careers`. Recommended architecture:

```
Browser (file_picker) → multipart POST → CF Worker → R2 bucket → Resend (path: r2_url)
```

This keeps CPU usage minimal and avoids the Cloudflare Workers free plan 10ms CPU limit. For a typical resume PDF (100KB–2MB), direct base64 encoding in the Worker might also work but is less reliable on the free tier.

**Key constraints:**
- `file_picker` package recommended for Flutter web file selection
- Resend supports attachments via `attachments[].path` (public URL) or `attachments[].content` (base64)
- Resend limit: 40MB per email (~30MB raw after base64 overhead)
- CF Workers free plan: 10ms CPU limit — base64 encoding large files can exceed this
- R2 approach avoids CPU-bound encoding; Resend fetches from the R2 URL server-side
- Blocked file types (Resend): `.exe`, `.bat`, `.js`, `.ps1`, etc. PDFs/DOCX are fine

**Implementation steps:**
1. Add `file_picker` dependency, show upload widget on `/contact?ref=careers`
2. Create R2 bucket for resume uploads
3. Update CF Worker to accept multipart POST, write file to R2, pass R2 URL to Resend
4. Add file type/size validation (client + server)

**Status:** Deferred — requires R2 bucket provisioning and Worker update.

---

### #133: Revert Careers CTA to "Submit Your Resume" After File Upload

**Priority**: P3 | **Source**: session 2026-03-11

Once #132 (resume upload) is implemented, revert the careers page CTA and copy:
- Button text: "Keep in Touch" → "Submit Your Resume"
- Description: restore "Send us your resume and a brief introduction..." (add "resume" back)

**Status:** Blocked on #132.

---

## Deferred: Server-Side Security Headers

These issues require **server-side HTTP response header configuration** and cannot be fixed in the Flutter app.

---

## Open Items

### OTEL Implementation (Session 2026-03-21)

#### L22: Type safety for makeOpts test helper

**Priority:** P4 | **Source:** code-reviewer (session 2026-03-21)

`makeOpts(sbOverride: any) => ...` in `ingest.test.ts:27` defeats type-checking. Should be typed as `SupabaseClient | null` or the minimal interface accepted by the handler. Prevents drift detection if the SupabaseClient interface changes.

#### L23: Rate-limit headers not forwarded on OTEL success response

**Priority:** P3 | **Source:** code-reviewer (session 2026-03-21)

`handleIngestOtel` calls `enforceOrgQuota` but discards the `rateLimitHeaders` (only checks `.ok`). Org-route handlers forward `X-RateLimit-Remaining-*` headers to callers. OTEL endpoint should match this pattern for consistency.

#### L24: start_time_ms lacks upper bound validation

**Priority:** P4 | **Source:** code-reviewer (session 2026-03-21)

`OtelSpanSchema.start_time_ms` is `z.number().int().nonnegative()` with no upper bound. Accepts future timestamps and epoch 0. Consider `.max(Date.now() + 86_400_000)` to catch obviously invalid input. — `workers/lib/types/usage.ts:134`

#### L25: OTEL_INGEST_ROUTE path duplicated between files

**Priority:** P4 | **Source:** code-reviewer (session 2026-03-21)

The literal `'/v1/ingest/otel'` appears in `ingest.ts` (line 133 as `const OTEL_INGEST_ROUTE`) and `index.ts` (line 88 in route match). Should export constant from `ingest.ts` and import in `index.ts` to avoid drift. — `workers/api-gateway/src/routes/ingest.ts:133`

## Payment Processor Security Remediation

Deferred security hardening for the two-layer authentication and billing system. Findings documented in `docs/security/SECURITY_VULNERABILITY_REPORT.md` and `docs/reports/JWT_COMPLIANCE_REVIEW.md`.

---

### T28: Handle Persistent Storage Data Loss Risk in Quota DO

**Priority:** P3 | **Source:** session 2026-03-20, quota commit review (523518f)
**Estimated:** 2–3 hours

Quota state is lazily persisted to Durable Object storage every 10 seconds (`workers/api-gateway/src/durable-objects/quota.ts:174–177`). If the DO crashes or is evicted between saves, up to 10 seconds of quota usage is lost (counts are dropped, monthly counter reverts).

**Scope:**
1. Evaluate risk appetite: Is 10-second data loss acceptable for quota tracking? (likely yes for low-tier plans, needs confirmation)
2. If higher durability is required:
   - Change save interval to synchronous: save immediately after every reservation (impacts latency)
   - OR batch saves: write to Durable Object every 100 requests OR 5 seconds (hybrid approach)
   - OR implement eventual consistency mode: accept up-to-10s drift, document in API contract
3. Document the chosen strategy in `workers/docs/QUOTA_DURABLE_OBJECTS.md` with:
   - Data consistency SLA
   - Acceptable loss window
   - When DO eviction is expected (low-traffic orgs evicted after 15 min idle)
4. Add monitoring: Cloudflare Durable Object metrics dashboard to track eviction rate

**Files to modify:**
- `workers/api-gateway/src/durable-objects/quota.ts` — Adjust save strategy (if needed)
- `workers/docs/QUOTA_DURABLE_OBJECTS.md` — Document durability guarantees and trade-offs

**Status:** Deferred — Documented but requires risk/latency trade-off decision and monitoring setup.

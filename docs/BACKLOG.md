# Security & Infrastructure Backlog

Open and deferred items only. Completed items are documented in `docs/changelog/1.0/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Deferred: OAuth Security (#8-#10)

These issues are **deferred** because this is a landing page with placeholder OAuth callback UI and no OAuth backend.
When OAuth is implemented, these MUST be added.

| Issue | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| #8 OAuth State Validation | CRITICAL | CSRF via unvalidated `state` parameter |
| #9 PKCE Implementation | CRITICAL | Authorization code interception (RFC 7636) |
| #10 Auth Code Validation | CRITICAL | Success shown before token exchange |

See git history for full implementation plans (removed from backlog on 2026-02-12 migration to CHANGELOG).

## Accepted Risk

### #23: KV Eventual Consistency Window

**Severity:** HIGH (accepted risk)
**Category:** Reliability
**File:** `workers/contact-form/src/index.ts:130-152`

KV is eventually consistent. Two requests from same IP at different datacenters can both read count=4, both increment to 5. Rate limit can be exceeded by ~2-3x.

**Status:** Accepted risk for contact form use case.

---

### #30: Multi-Environment CSP Endpoints

**Severity:** LOW (accepted)
**Category:** Infrastructure
**File:** `web/_headers`

CSP report-uri/report-to endpoints shared across staging/production. Staging is Cloudflare Pages preview deployments using the same `_headers` file. All reports go to the same Sentry project.

**Status:** Accepted for landing page use case. Documented in `web/_headers`. If env-specific reporting is needed, use a build script to replace the DSN.

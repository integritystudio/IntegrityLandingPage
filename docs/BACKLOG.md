# Security & Infrastructure Backlog

Open and deferred items only. Completed items are documented in `docs/changelog/1.0/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Deferred: OAuth Security (#8-#10)

These issues are **deferred** because this is a landing page with placeholder OAuth callback UI and no OAuth backend.
When OAuth is implemented, these MUST be added.

| Issue | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| #8 OAuth State Validation | CRITICAL | CSRF via unvalidated `state` parameter |
| #9 PKCE Implementation | CRITICAL | Authorization code interception (RFC 7636) |
| #10 Auth Code Validation | CRITICAL | Success shown before token exchange |

See git history for full implementation plans (removed from backlog on 2026-02-12 migration to CHANGELOG).

## Accepted Risk

### #23: KV Eventual Consistency Window

**Severity:** HIGH (accepted risk)
**Category:** Reliability
**File:** `workers/contact-form/src/index.ts:130-152`

KV is eventually consistent. Two requests from same IP at different datacenters can both read count=4, both increment to 5. Rate limit can be exceeded by ~2-3x.

**Status:** Accepted risk for contact form use case.

---

### #30: Multi-Environment CSP Endpoints

**Severity:** LOW (accepted)
**Category:** Infrastructure
**File:** `web/_headers`

CSP report-uri/report-to endpoints shared across staging/production. Staging is Cloudflare Pages preview deployments using the same `_headers` file. All reports go to the same Sentry project.

**Status:** Accepted for landing page use case. Documented in `web/_headers`. If env-specific reporting is needed, use a build script to replace the DSN.

## Blocked: Chrome Platform Tests (#77)

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Category:** Test Infrastructure
**Status:** Blocked — `flutter test --platform chrome` hangs indefinitely

`flutter test --platform chrome` never executes — hangs at "loading" forever, even on a trivial empty test. This blocks all web-only test coverage (#75, #76) and prevents testing `kIsWeb` branches.

### Root Cause

The `package:test` Chrome runner fails to establish WebSocket communication with headless Chrome. Affects both DDC (default) and `--wasm` compilation modes. The test compiles successfully but the runner never receives a response from Chrome.

### Environment

- Flutter 3.38.5 (stable, 2025-12-11)
- Chrome 145.0.7632.160
- ChromeDriver 145.0.7632.117
- macOS 26.2 (darwin-arm64)
- `flutter doctor`: Chrome detected, no issues reported

### What Was Tried

1. `flutter test --platform chrome test/web_smoke_test.dart` — hangs at "loading" (60s timeout, 0 tests ran)
2. `flutter test --platform chrome --wasm test/web_smoke_test.dart` — compiles wasm successfully, still hangs at "loading"
3. `CHROME_EXECUTABLE=... flutter test --platform chrome` — same hang
4. `flutter test --platform chrome -v` — verbose log stops at "Found 1 files which will be executed as Widget Tests", never reaches Chrome launch

### Prerequisite Fix Applied

`test/helpers/test_content.dart` previously used `dart:io` (`File.existsSync`) which caused a compile error on web. Fixed with conditional imports:
- `load_content_native.dart` — `dart:io` file read
- `load_content_web.dart` — `rootBundle.loadString()` for browser
- `load_content_stub.dart` — fallback stub
- `flutter_test_config.dart` — `kIsWeb` branch with `TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`

### Unblocks

- **#75**: `_launchUrl` error handling test (`footer_section.dart:13-26`)
- **#76**: `_initializeTracking` error handling test (`app.dart:36-66`)
- All `kIsWeb` branch coverage in `app.dart` (currently ~50% native ceiling)

### Next Steps

- Check if Flutter 3.40+ fixes the `package:test` Chrome runner
- Try `dart_test.yaml` with custom `browsers: [{name: chrome, flags: [...]}]`
- Consider `flutter drive --platform chrome --profile` as alternative (worked for E2E in E4)

## Deferred: Platform-Limited Test Coverage Gaps

These changelog items have error-handling code that cannot be tested without `flutter test --platform chrome`.
When web-platform CI is added, these MUST be covered.

### #75: `_launchUrl` Error Handling Test Coverage

**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Test Coverage
**File:** `lib/widgets/sections/footer_section.dart:13-26`

`_launchUrl` wraps `launchUrl()` in try/catch with `ErrorTrackingService.captureException`. The error path cannot be triggered in native widget tests because `url_launcher` uses platform channels that cannot be mocked to throw from the call site.

**Status:** Deferred until web-platform test CI is available.

---

### #76: `_initializeTracking` Error Handling Test Coverage

**Severity:** LOW
**Category:** Test Coverage
**File:** `lib/app.dart:36-66`

`_initializeTracking()` is wrapped in try/catch, but the tracking branches (`kIsWeb`, `ConsentManager.hasConsent()`, `TrackingWeb.*`) are unreachable in native tests. `kIsWeb` is a compile-time constant — native tests always evaluate to `false`, skipping all tracking logic. See `test/app_test.dart:690-701`.

**Status:** Deferred until web-platform test CI is available.
